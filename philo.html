   	<p>Humorology is the largest student-run philanthropy in the state of Wisconsin.</p>
      <h2>This year's beneficiary is... the Canopy Center!</h2>
      <h3>What is the Canopy Center?</h3>
      <p>The Canopy Center is  child abuse treatment and prevention agency that works to strengthen and support children, teens, adults, and families affected by trauma and adversity. The Canopy Center serves over 500 families annually in the Dane County community. Their programs include Oasis which provides trauma focused therapy to children who have experienced sexual abuse, Parent to Child which provides a safe space for children to visit parents when courts have ordered interactions to be supervised, and CASA or “Court Appointed Special Advocates” where volunteers work to be independent voices for children who are under the legal protection of the courts due to absence or neglect.</p>
      <h3>What will the money we raise go towards?</h3>
      <p>The money we raise will be used to help hire/pay additional staff and update/replenish their trauma care rooms. We are very excited to be working with this organization, and hope to raise as much in support of them as we can.</p>
